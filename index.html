          <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Derek Tumala | <strong>Medium:</strong> Digital Art | <strong>Year:</strong> 2022</p>
          <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This digital desert scene makes extreme heat feel real. By showing a lone monolith and a glowing sun in a burned-out landscape, it reminds us that rising temperatures aren’t just numbers—they’re reshaping our homes, farms, and daily lives.

            <li class="ul"><strong>Color & Value:</strong> Warm golds bathe the scene; deep shadows amp up drama.</li>
            <li class="ul"><strong>Texture & Space:</strong> Smooth, reflective sculptures vs. gritty sand; plants in front to faded dunes in back create depth.</li>
            <li class="ul"><strong>Balance & Emphasis:</strong> Vertical monolith counterbalances glowing portal; bright orb demands focus.</li>
            <li class="ul"><strong>Contrast & Movement:</strong> Light vs. dark & smooth vs. rough heighten tension; curving ridges and shadows guide the eye.</li>

          <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Ducat’s rainbow-tree painting turns a walk in the woods into a burst of color. By showing forests as living rainbows, it reminds us how vital trees are for clean air and cool summers—and why we must protect them.
